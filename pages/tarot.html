        Major Arcana 0. The Fool
        <br />
        Upright: The Fool indicates one who is ready to take the first steps in
        a new direction and explore previously untapped potential. There is a
        deep naivety about the Fool, representing someone who lives in the
        moment and looks ahead only to positive possibilities. The impetus to
        move forward is only done on a whim, plain and simple. The optimistic
        nature of this card is buoyed by a bit of good luck and a predilection
        for adventure.

        <br />Reverse: What are the areas in your life where you are reticent
        for no reason? In this position, the Fool cautions us to check our
        stubborn, petulant side. Take responsibility for your own missteps.
        Uncharted territory can be anxiety-inducing. Do not let this fear make
        you afraid of new opportunities. Do not be afraid of growth.
        <br />
        <br />Modern Witch Instructional Guide: The grand adventure begins! The
        fearless Fool with her devil-may-care attitude is ready to take the
        first steps toward the unknown. Pure passion and optimism fuel her as
        she dances to her music, to joy itself. She doesn’t know what lies
        beyond the cliff’s edge, but she’s left behind her life in the city.
        Goodbye to normalcy, to routine, to the structured life she’d had within
        society. She fully trusts her instincts to carry her beyond the
        ordinary. <br />Don’t be afraid to take that leap of faith. Now is the
        time for you to start your journey, because you’re ready. Be spontaneous
        and let your wildness run free. Don’t look back in fear, look ahead and
        up to the sky and sun and let your instincts guide you. You got this.
        <br />
        <br />Upright Summary: The Fool Upright speaks of new beginnings,
        innocence, spontaneity, potential, possibility, and opportunity. Just
        like The Fool standing at the cliff’s edge, you are ready to take a leap
        of faith. The Fool is encouraging you to do so. Follow your heart, have
        an open mind, be curious, and throw caution to the wind. Take your first
        steps into the unknown and don’t worry about the consequences – you are
        destined to unlock your full potential by taking a risk. The Fool is one
        who lives in the moment. Like the Fool on the cliff, you are a free
        spirit. Relax, play, have a little fun, live life as though you were a
        naïve child once again, and take your first steps in a new direction on
        a whim. Your free spirit lives in the moment and is ready to embrace
        possibility and opportunity. The Fool is encouraging you to take that
        leap of faith. <br />Joclyn (my interpretation)
        <br />
        <br />Reverse Summary: The Fool Reverse speaks of holding back, coming
        to a standstill, or a resistance to moving forward. You are worried that
        you are not quite ready to take your leap of faith. Like The Upside Down
        Fool paused at the edge of the cliff, unable to move forward, something
        is holding you back. You are worried about taking action without knowing
        the outcome. But, despite the fact that you are uncertain of what will
        ocme next, The Fool encourages you to take this step forward.
        Alternatively, The Fool Reverse speaks of recklessness and risk-taking.
        You have an utter disregard for the consequences of your actions in an
        attempt to live in the moment and be spontaneous. You are adventurous
        and risk-taking, but at the expense of your own, as well as others’,
        safety and well-being. The Fool encourages you to take responsibility
        for your actions and to overcome the fear of growth and seizing new
        opportunities. <br />Joclyn (my interpretation) <br />I. The Magician
        <br />Upright: The Magician makes efficient use of all available tools.
        While the Fool daydreams of grand possibility, the Magician takes the
        steps necessary to realize those dreams. There is planning and
        intentionality involved, as well as resourcefulness and a clarity of
        purpose. While the Fool relies on luck, the Magician knows luck favors
        the prepared.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The Magician in this position is a reminder that desire
        for control can be stifling or even destructive. In this case, the
        inclination to plan is almost solely motivated by fear. Even the best
        laid plans can be upended, but it is still possible to move forward
        after stumbling. Beware of those subtle manipulators who seek to wrest
        control of your fate out from your own hands.
        <br />
        <br />Modern Witch Instructional Guide: It’s time to make some magic, to
        turn dreams into reality. The Magician knows what she wants and knows
        what she’ll need to make it happen. Standing confidently and boldly,
        brandishing a wand towards the sky, The Magician channels magic and
        inspiration into herself and transforms it into creative energy. Laid
        out before her is all she needs on a crystalline pedestal. The sword—her
        smarts and wit—prepares her for the task ahead. Her cup is full and
        emotionally connects The Magician to her goal. The pentacle is the life
        experience that taught her how the world works. The other wand drives
        her forward into action. <br />Bring those lofty dreams down to earth,
        make them real! You know what you want, and you have the magic within
        you to make it happen! Believe in yourself, you know that you’re ready
        to start creating. Let that inspiration flow through you and use all
        your tools to make some stuff!
        <br />
        <br />Upright Summary: The Magician Upright speaks of manifestation,
        resourcefulness, power, intentionality, and inspired action. Like The
        Magician, you have all of the tools, resources, energy, and anything
        else you could possibly need right now to manifest your intentions. Now
        is the time to take action and move forward with your ideas or goals and
        turn them into reality. The Magician is a powerful, creative, and
        resourceful being, and you are too. Know that in order to achieve your
        goals and manifestation, you will need to be focused, attentive,
        concentrated, prepared, and committed. It won’t be easy, but like The
        Magician, you have gathered significant knowledge, skills, and
        capabilities throughout your life that will aid you. You need to
        establish a clear vision (your “what”) and a clear reason (your “why”)
        in order to manifest. The Magician knows they must have a clarity of
        purpose, with deep and soulful motivation other than superficial and
        shallow motivation. Combine your four elements with the spiritual and
        earthly realms and you will be a manifestation powerhouse! While The
        Fool daydreams of possibility, The Magician is ready to take the
        necessary steps to make that possibility come true, and you are too.
        <br />Joclyn (my interpretation)
        <br />
        <br />Reverse Summary: The Magician Reverse speaks of manipulation, poor
        planning, untapped talents, and uncertainty. Perhaps you are exploring
        what you wish to manifest but are not taking action yet. Perhaps you are
        questioning if you have everything you need and/or how to make it
        happen. Pay attention to opportunities as they arise. If you know what
        you want, the “how” will come to you eventually. The Magician Reverse
        suggests that you are struggling to see progress or success, or you are
        taking misdirected action. You might have lost touch with or are not
        compelled by your “why”, resulting in a lack of motivation. Your real,
        full potential is not being accessed. The Magician urges you to unleash
        your potential and to overcome any fear. The Magician Reverse can also
        speak of greed and trickery. Perhaps you are an excellent manifestor,
        but you do so at the expense of others. Ask yourself if you are hurting
        others (or yourself) with your manifestation. The Magician advises you
        to refrain from doing so. Your motivation is corrupt, shallow, or
        superficial. The Magician Reverse urges you to step back and examine
        your motivation, your methods, your potential, and the effects of your
        actions in order to manifest properly, successfully, and safely.
        <br />Joclyn (my interpretation)
        <br />
        <br />II. The High Priestess <br />Upright: The High Priestess is a
        symbol of wisdom and introspection. The moon and the sun held up by the
        pillars illustrate how both clarity and mystery can support the same
        essential truths. While the Magician makes use of the known world
        looking outward, the High Priestess turns inward. When the observable
        truth presents more obstacles than solutions, it may be appropriate to
        trust the things you know but cannot yet name. Trust your heart.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: In this position, the High Priestess encourages us to
        discern the difference between a mystery and a lie. Trusting your
        intuition must be tempered with a healthy degree of skepticism. Are you
        unable to name your challenges because they are new? Or is it because
        the full scope of the truth has been concealed from you? Who is keeping
        secrets?
        <br />
        <br />Modern Witch Instructional Guide: There are deep secrets and many
        mysteries in life. The High Priestess knows the path toward them. She
        sits on her throne, with her laptop full of secret knowledge and wisdom,
        pensive but inviting. Behind her, a veil of pomegranates suggests the
        desire for answers is there, but we may not be ready to lift this veil
        of mysteries. The moon, at her feet, seeks to awaken our unconscious and
        opens us up to hidden things and the strangest parts of existing.
        <br />Be still. Sometimes the greatest power comes in knowing that you
        do not know anything. You’ve come up against the truth that more
        self-knowledge is needed, and it’s time to reflect in order to grow.
        Explore your subconscious, through meditation, through tarot itself,
        through study. It’s not time to make big decisions right now.
        <br />
        <br />Upright Summary: The High Priestess Upright speaks of intuition,
        sacred knowledge, the Divine Feminine, the subconscious mind,
        enlightenment, illumination, wisdom, introspection, and Divine
        Knowledge. Like The High Priestess, you have an extraordinary balance
        between your conscious and subconscious minds, and can travel between
        the two realms significantly easier than most. The High Priestess
        understands that the world is not always as it seems, and that there are
        deeper, more profound forces at play. You, likewise, have a deep,
        intuitive understanding of the Universe and of this truth. You may have
        a heightened awareness of hidden or secret information. The veil between
        you and the underworld is thin, and you are able to access knowledge
        deep within your soul. Be still. Tune into your sacred feminine; it
        needs your attention right now. Be compassionate, be empathetic,
        collaborate, create, feel. Most importantly, The High Priestess is a
        sign of intuition. Just like The High Priestess, you are a uniquely
        intuitive person. She encourages you to nurture your intuition and to
        listen to it. While The Magician connects with the world by turning
        outward, The High Priestess turns inward. She urges you tto tap into
        your subconscious, your knack for discovering concealed knowledge, your
        intuition. <br />Joclyn (my interpretation)
        <br />
        <br />Reverse Summary: The High Priestess Reverse speaks of secrets,
        disconnect from intuition, withdrawal, and silence. The High Priestess
        in this position invites you to be still and direct your attention
        inward. You may be too focused on the opinions and excursions of others
        – it would be wise to focus on yourself and spend time reflecting on
        what is right for you. You may doubt your intuition and/or deny your
        ability, but you should know that your intuition is powerful and useful,
        and it is on your side. The High Priestess represents the raw and
        authentic center within you that is untouched and untainted by your
        external world. You may have lost touch with this part of yourself, and
        The High Priestess advises you to try and regain that connection.
        Meditate, find her voice, take a break from the chaos of the outside
        world, clear your head, and let your intuition speak to you. The High
        Priestess Reverse also speaks of gossip and hidden agendas. It is
        possible that information is being withheld from you, or someone is
        keeping secrets from you, or sharing mistruths. The High Priestess
        Reverse can also alternatively suggest that you are placing too much
        trust in your intuition and instinct, and you must temper yourself with
        more rationality. <br />Joclyn (my interpretation) <br />III. The
        Empress <br />Upright: The Empress is representative of generosity and
        comfort. The Fool wishes, the Magician plans, the High Priestess
        ponders, and the Empress provides. This card indicates the satisfaction
        of natural desires through careful cultivation and mindful stewardship.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: Priorities must be reassessed. You may have neglected to
        attend to those things that are essential to your happiness. Attempts to
        convey care and thoughtfulness have twisted into something smothering
        and overbearing. If you overwater your plants, their roots will rot.
        <br />
        <br />Modern Witch Instructional Guide: Love is everything. The Empress
        is feeling herself! This benevolent goddess is alive and truly connected
        to the world and others through passion and pure emotions. The Empress
        is empowered by her love and sexuality, and her energy flows through
        everything around her. She gives life to the lush vegetation and
        receives life from the powerful river. She welcomes pleasure and
        feelings, and fills each moment with ecstasy. <br />Think less, feel
        more. Embrace self-love, and use that self-love to build stronger and
        more profound connections with family, friends, or lovers. Be fulfilled
        by your social circles of those who love you. Drink from the cup of
        love, allow it to nourish and warm you. Through love, you can find deep
        meaning and fulfillment. Love, love, love! It’s all here for you if you
        let it in.
        <br />
        <br />Upright Summary: The Empress Upright speaks of femininity, beauty,
        nature, nurturing, abundance, elegance, sensuality, fertility, creative
        expression, pleasures, luxuries, comfort, growth, fruition, and
        generosity. The Empress encourages you to create beauty in your life,
        connect with your senses, indulge yourself, and offer recognition and
        gratitude for all you’ve created. The Empress is the Mother Earth
        archetype. Likewise, you pursue both a literal connection to nature and
        the outdoors as well as a metaphorical connection to creation,
        nurturing, and providing. You love to care for and tend to others in a
        motherly fashion. The Empress Upright can furthermore suggest that you
        are stepping into the role of ‘mother’, which could be literal or
        metaphorical. While The Fool wishes, The Magician plans, and The High
        Priestess ponders, The Empress provides. <br />Joclyn (my
        interpretation)
        <br />
        <br />Reverse Summary: The Emress Reverse speaks of creative block and
        dependence on others. She encourages you to reassess your priorities,
        and place an emphasis on self-love and self-care. You have fostered a
        negligence for your own needs due to placing too much emphasis on
        someone else’s needs. Refrain from doing so, and take some time to love
        and care for yourself. The Empress reminds you that it is essential your
        cup is full, so that you can then fill others’. She also encourages you
        to pursue a connection with Mother Earth and nature. You might be
        experiencing trouble expressing yourself creatively. That’s okay;
        creative energy ebbs and flows as with all things. Just focus, breathe,
        hone your creativity, and try to create something, regardless of how
        “good” you think it is or what others might think. Additionally, you may
        have issues around body image. It’s time to try and accept and love your
        instrument; it has carried you this far. The Empress Reverse also speaks
        of overprotectiveness, codependency, and controllingness. You may take
        the ‘mothering’ role too far in your relationships. The Empress
        encourages you to shift from mother-child relationships to adult-adult
        relationships. Create independence, trust, and loving compassion. If you
        overwater your plants, their roots wil rot. <br />Joclyn (my
        interpretation) <br />IV. The Emperor <br />Upright: The Emperor brings
        steady leadership and direction, and represents reliability and
        organization. Under the Emperor’s leadership, there is a protocol at the
        ready for every possible challenge. The world is represented on his
        scepter, tying the Emperor to the suit of Coins. The eagle indicates a
        sharpness of mind, a connection to the suit of Swords. You find yourself
        confident in your capacity to make responsible decisions for yourself
        and others. You have done as much preparation as is necessary, so move
        forward with your plans.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: In this position, the Emperor is a tyrannical figure.
        Power is abused and corrupted. Institutions are rigid, unmoving, and
        unfair. The tallest fortress walls are only a veneer, and they will
        crumble under the slightest scrutiny. Beware of those who feel entitled
        to your loyalty, your labor, and your livelihood. Likewise, be careful
        not to overstep your sense of authority.
        <br />
        <br />Modern Witch Instructional Guide: Boundaries and structure make us
        feel safe. The Emperor is full of authority and creates a world full of
        rules and laws. She is a comforting answer to the chaos of the natural
        world, but she is rigid and uncompromising on her stony throne. She
        requires logic and reason above all else, and she is unafraid to lead
        and take the reins to shape the world around her. Though she lords over
        a powerful and grand cityscape, the river of life has slowed to a
        trickle behind her. <br />Protect yourself, if you need to. Don’t allow
        others to walk all over you, and don’t be afraid to stand up, take
        charge and force cange. Logic and reason may be the best approach for a
        particular problem, and by creating some stability in your life you may
        be able to release some anxiety. Don’t lose touch with your compassion
        though; stubbornness and stoicism will not always be the best answer.
        <br />
        <br />Upright Summary: The Emperor Upright speaks of authority,
        establishment, structure, a father figure, rules, regulation, world
        knowledge, expertise, wisdom, reliability, and organization. You may be
        adopting a fatherly role in some aspect of your life. Like The Emperor,
        you are a powerful leader most comfortable in such a position, who
        demands respect and authority, with an emphasis on status, power, and
        recognition. Your rule is firm but fair. The Emperor encourages you to
        claim your authority, claim your leadership, your influence, and don’t
        let others bring you down. Be systematic, strategic, and stick to your
        plan. The Emperor creates order in chaos by applying guidelines and
        principles. Throughout your life, you have gathered wisdom and
        experience, and it’s time to share it with others. You enjoy offering
        guidance, advice, and direction to your disciples and listeners. The
        Emperor encourages you to teach what you have learned. <br />Joclyn (my
        interpretation)
        <br />
        <br />Reverse Summary: The Emperor Reverse speaks of domination,
        excessive control, lack of discipline, inflexibility, domineering,
        rigidity, father issues, unequal relationships, unfairness, and tyranny.
        The Emperor encourages you to reassess your relationship with power,
        control, authority, responsibility, and discipline. How is your balance
        with these elements? Is there too much in your life? Too little? Are
        they on your side or are they an opposition to you? The Emperor suggests
        an abuse of authorative power, either by the querent or by a significant
        figure in their life, for example their father. It would be wise to
        reconsider your power – are you abusing it and crushing other’s personal
        power, or are you throwing it away to someone else and crushing your own
        personal power? The Emperor Reverse can also suggest that you are
        frustrated by being restrained by the confines of a particular
        structure, method, leader, or authority. The Emperor invites you to
        stand up to authority in this case. You may also be shying away from a
        leadership role, and in that case, find another way to make an impact on
        the world with more subtlety. (Or embrace the position and try your best
        to be a benevolent leader to others). The Emperor asks you: are you
        struggling to get a job done? If so, formulate a plan, a routine,
        dedication, and do the rough work that you would rather not do. Channel
        the organization, expertise, and personal power of The Emperor to aid
        you. <br />Joclyn (my interpretation) <br />V. The Hierophant
        <br />Upright: While the High Priestess represents our internal
        spiritual workings, the Hierophant is a figure of benign externalized
        spirituality—a representation of spiritual authority, guidance, and
        tradition. The keys mark the Hierophant as a gatekeeper. Though there
        may be some preparation and commitment necessary, it may be worthwhile
        to seek an organized outlet for a shared expression of spirituality.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The Hierophant in reverse is a dogmatic figure who must
        be questioned. The systems and traditions from which the Hierophant’s
        authority is granted might be oppressive, bloated by corruption, or
        twisted with hypocrisy. Interrogate whether your expressions of
        spirituality are hollow displays of piety or truly meant to serve the
        greater good.
        <br />
        <br />Modern Witch Instructional Guide: As students, we learn from the
        past and from others. It is the Hierophant that calls us to unlock our
        psyche and hidden potential through diligent study. She is wise in her
        guidance, helping us discover new things we could not have found alone.
        As students and disciples, we kneel at her feet, listening to her
        stories and lessons, and if we do so, we may be able to find the lock
        that fits the keys crossed at her feet. <br />Look to the past, read
        books, find a community of both differing worldview and familiar ones.
        Find the passion within you and the hunger to know more. Nothing is
        created in a void, and you can enrich yourself by finding communities or
        collectives that help to structure your study. Learning new things can
        open your mind to new pathways and possibilities.
        <br />
        <br />VI. The Lovers <br />Upright: The Lovers represent mutual desire.
        They herald healthy partnerships, unions both of consent and enthusiasm.
        There is attraction and passionate exploration fueled by a mutual
        curiosity, signified by the apples. The presence of the apples in this
        deck serves as a symbol of curiosity fulfilled and of maturity. The
        relationship feels like paradise and all parties seem to be getting what
        they want and need. A healthy balance is struck between desire and
        promise, wishing and fulfillment.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The Lovers reversed warns of broken unions. A cycle of
        mutual desire and beneficence is broken, leaving one or all involved
        parties feeling incomplete and bereft. The card may also indicate that a
        partnership has stagnated and begun to fester without proper care and
        attention. Can Eden be forever? <br />VII. The Chariot <br />Upright:
        The Chariot is a card of steady progression and clear goals. It
        represents healthy motivation, willpower, and practical application of
        wisdom. The Chariot represents certainty. There is a definitive sense of
        direction that propels the journey. Challenges are considered,
        addressed, and overcome. The black and white cats indicate duality, and
        they look in two different directions. The Chariot has no reins and is
        propelled by force of will.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The Chariot reversed asks you to interrogate your goals
        and means of achieving them. Check for undue ruthlessness and question
        honestly whether the ends are worth the current means. There may be
        better ways forward. The Chariot may also be telling you that you are
        being pulled in several different directions, but you can only chart one
        way forward. Take a step back and figure out what your motivations
        should be before you continue your journey. <br />VIII. Fortitude
        <br />Upright: Fortitude is the representative of courage, and there is
        no courage without fear. This card indicated that you have found a
        healthy measure of patience for yourself. This is a reminder to
        acknowledge your shortcomings and all the anxieties that accompany them,
        and then work your way forward. The lotus flower represents the way that
        strength is cultivated. Out of the mist and through the water, a
        beautiful flower rises.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: In this position, Fortitude reminds you to be more
        patient with yourself. Our shortcomings, our flaws, and all our past
        mistakes are parts of us, but those things should not hinder our growth.
        If we are not gentle and patient with ourselves, how can we cultivate
        our growth? Progress requires risk; remind yourself that you are worth
        that risk. <br />IX. The Hermit <br />Upright: The Hermit is similar to
        the High Priestess with an emphasis on seeking the truth, but the Hermit
        is more concerned with assessing everything that has happened to inform
        your place in the world. Perhaps difficult decisions were made, but you
        have largely made peace with the outcome. The Hermit represents a need
        for introspections and retreat. Sometimes it is difficult to be in the
        world, so it is necessary to step back and affirm yourself. The Hermit
        uses a sounding staff to gently alert those around you that you are
        moving through a space.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: In reverse, the Hermit lacks certainty. Did you do the
        right thing? You may have withdrawn into yourself out of fear of
        irreparable mistakes. Your confidence is broken, and you are unable to
        forgive yourself. You self-isolate to hide from the world and turn your
        eyes away from the choices that led you here. It is time to come out of
        hiding and face your fears. <br />X. Wheel of Fate <br />Upright: The
        Wheel of Fate is a reminder that things are as they are meant to be.
        There are good turns and there are bad turns, but so long as the Wheel
        turns, life proceeds. It is a reminder that, despite all its highs and
        lows, life continues. The Wheel of Fate generally heralds a certain
        amount of good luck.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The Wheel has hit a snag, unable to move forward.
        Sometimes challenges can slow you down, but it’s important not to let
        them stop you altogether. Things cannot get better if you dwell on your
        lowest points. In this position, the Wheel encourages you to keep going,
        or else your poor luck will never change. <br />XI. Justice
        <br />Upright: Justice reminds us to actively course-correct those
        instances of institutional bias. It is not simply a matter of what is
        fair. Justice interrogates which lenses are corrupted by structures that
        value a concentration of power. Regardless of whether or not it benefits
        you personally, value and pursue what is right instead of, or perhaps
        despite, what is popular.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: Justice reversed is a reminder to ask when and how we are
        complicit in perpetuating injustice. What do you omit from your personal
        narrative to protect your comfort? What stake do you have in maintaining
        the status quo? You currently benefit from someone else’s loss, and you
        must take steps to correct this. <br />XII. The Hanged Man
        <br />Upright: The Hanged Man is an appeal to patience. It might feel
        like too much is currently on hold but perhaps this is for the best. The
        Hanged Man asks you to be patient with yourself and serves as a reminder
        that growth comes slowly. Be assured that biding your time is not the
        same as wasting it. There is no sense in picking a fruit before it has
        time to ripen.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: In reverse, the Hanged Man warns that your personal
        stagnation might be due to an inability to articulate those frustrating
        things that give you pause. Are you giving yourself a reprieve, or are
        you clinging to this moment because change is difficult? The card asks
        how others might be adversely affected by your willful stubbornness.
        <br />XIII. Death <br />Upright: The Death card portends change. Nyx
        holds her child, Thanatos, gently beckoning souls into the next life.
        Though it may initially read as a bad omen, Death simply refers to
        cycles of change in a broader sense. When an era comes to a close, a new
        one springs up at its heels. The figure of Death in this case signifies
        satisfactory closure and completion.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: Death in reverse warns of ghosts. You may lack proper
        closure, and be unable to let go of the past. By dwelling on life as it
        was, you cannot proceed, and you forget to live. <br />XIV. Temperance
        <br />Upright: Temperance signifies self-discipline and strength of
        character. As Death suggests an ever changing world, Temperance
        represents the certainty that the most essential parts of ourselves will
        remain. Despite the challenges and the pain that often accompany change
        and growth, you may find that your strong personal and interpersonal
        foundations help keep you grounded.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The reversed Temperance card reveals that those things we
        cling to in times of upheaval are not as reliable as we once believed.
        Examine your personal and interpersonal habits and honestly determine
        which of those things perpetuate patterns that drain you of your
        resources, your energy, your compassion, and your creativity. <br />XV.
        The Devil <br />Upright: The Devil is the avatar of compulsion and
        desire. Though we are inclined to temper our indulgent impulses, it is
        sometimes healthy to seek an outlet for them. You might take the next
        opportunity to yield to your passions. It could be just what you need.
        However, the Devil also warns you not to lose yourself in your passions
        or they will become your vices.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: Your penchant for self-restraint and discipline has
        become stifling. Though you are dutiful and responsible, you have denied
        yourself joy and satisfaction in your day-to-day living. When good
        behavior is its own reward, it might be difficult to find motivation. It
        may also be that your pursuit of pleasure has taken a turn for the
        worse, and what began as a momentary release has developed into a bad
        habit. <br />XVI. The Tower <br />Upright: The Tower bodes upheaval,
        moments where you are shaken to your very core and can feel your
        foundations crumbling beneath you. You may wonder who you have become.
        That which you have built to protect yourself may be the very thing that
        ultimately crushes you. In the broadest sense, a revolt has occurred,
        and old institutions can no longer stand.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: The walls you have built remain strong, but you never
        leave them. In an effort to hide from the wind and cold, you have also
        shut away the sun and stars. You resist change because it may entail
        starting over. To your mind, a fresh start is more of a threat than a
        new opportunity. <br />XVII. The Star <br />Upright: The Star is the
        guardian of this deck. She represents hope and endless possibility. The
        Star gently nurtures the flowers, and the ibis, a steward of creativity
        and magic, circles about her. After the Tower has fallen and the light
        of dusk fades into night, the Star is there to help you make your way
        through the dark. All you have to do is look up.
        <br />
        <br />Reverse: As the dust settles and the Tower lies in ruin, you may
        find yourself alone in the dark. Reversed, the Star cautions that you
        have fallen deep in despair and cannot move forward. Signs of hope seem
        too good to be true, and you feel more lost than ever. Take a moment to
        breathe and give yourself space to become reoriented. <br />XVIII. The
        Moon
